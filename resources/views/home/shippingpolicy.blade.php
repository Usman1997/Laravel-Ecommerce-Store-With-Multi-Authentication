The ship items out as soon as possible, but this will not always be the same day as your order. In general, please add 2-3 business days to allow for processing time. If we anticipate a longer lead time, it will be noted in the item description. If you have any questions about the lead time on a specific item, please contact us at : http://inoovo.com/support with your questions.<br/><br/>
You should receive an email confirming your order shortly after you’ve placed it. If you don’t receive that email, please check your spam folder and see if you can locate it. This is especially important because, if you haven’t received the order confirmation email, you also won’t receive the email with your shipment notification and tracking information.
<br/><br/>
If you are offered insurance, but do not accept it, we cannot be held responsible for damaged, lost, or stolen packages.</h5>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Domestic Shipping</h3><br/>
<h5>
Free Express Shipping in Pakistan for orders worth of PKR 5,000 or above. The customer will usually get an order in 3-5 business days after the order has shipped out. After your payment is authorized, it can take up to 2 days for us to process your order and ship it. This is just an estimate and does not include weekends and holidays. We do not ship to P.O Boxes. Delivery can take longer in remote areas in Pakistan. “Cash On Delivery” orders will be processed after successful telephonic verification. However, Gul Ahmed holds the right to process “Cash on Delivery” orders without telephonic verification for verified customers and/or during a period of high volume that include sale, season launches and other promotions.</h5>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Shipping Charges</h3>

Please note that you, the buyer, are responsible for any VAT, tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, customs clearance charges, etc. required by your country for importing consumer goods. We do not collect this beforehand, and can’t give you an estimate of the cost, because it varies widely around the world. Please do your research so you’re ready to get your package cleared through customs, and have an idea of what the additional cost will be.</h5><br/><br/>
